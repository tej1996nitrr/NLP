# NLP
Natural language processing using nltk.
A Repo for fundamentals/basics for natural language processing using nltk. This includes basics of topics like corpora, text processing, tagging, entity recognition, scrapping. WIll include nltk projects in future.

## Requirements:
 1. Python 3
 2. NLTK
 
## Installation:
1. The easiest way to get NLTK now is probably using pip with
 pip install nltk
2. After we have nltk, we will need to go into a python script and do:
  import nltk
  nltk.download()

## Running Code:
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. We have many code cells in the .py files, we can run them to view step by step output.
3. Or run the jupyter notebook version (.ipynb) in google colab or local jupyter notebook/lab.
